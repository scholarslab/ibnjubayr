Feature: Display Multiple Coverages
  As a theme developer
  I want to be able to display coverage data from a mixed collection of fields
  So that visitors can see all coverage data.

  @file_fixture
  Scenario: All Non-Feature Coverages
    Given I am logged into the admin console
    And I replace "themes/default/items/show.php" with "plugins/NeatlineFeatures/features/data/show-display-coverage-delim.php"
    And I click "Add a new item to your archive"
    And I enter "Cucumber: Display All Non-Feature Coverages" for the "Elements-50-0-text"      # Title
    And I enter "Display All Non-Feature Coverages" for the "Elements-49-0-text"      # Subject
    And I enter "Charlottesville, VA" into "Elements-38-0-free"
    And I see "#Elements-38-0-free" contains "Charlottesville, VA"
    And I click "add_element_38"
    And I enter "UVa" into "Elements-38-1-free"
    And I see "#Elements-38-1-free" contains "UVa"
    And I click on "Add Item"
    And I click "Display All Non-Feature Coverages"
    When I click "View Public Page"
    Then I should see text "Charlottesville, VA; UVa" in "#dublin-core-coverage"
    But I should not see text "null" in "#dublin-core-coverage"
