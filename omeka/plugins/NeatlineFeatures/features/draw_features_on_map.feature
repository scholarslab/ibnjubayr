  As an item editor
  I want to be able to annotate an item by drawing features on a map.

  Scenario: Coverage has a "Use Map" checkbox
    Given I am logged into the admin console
    And I click "Add a new item to your archive"
    When I click "Use Map" checkbox in "#element-38"
    Then I should see a map in "#element-38"
