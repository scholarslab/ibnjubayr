Feature: Test Coverage Data
  As a theme developer
  I want to be able to test whether a coverage datum is feature data or not
  So that I can determine how to handle different types of coverage data correctly.

  @kml
  @file_fixture
  Scenario: Test All Non-Feature Coverages
    Given I am logged into the admin console
    And I replace "themes/default/items/show.php" with "plugins/NeatlineFeatures/features/data/show-display-coverage-test.php"
    And I click "Add a new item to your archive"
    And I enter "Cucumber: Test Iterate All Non-Feature Coverages" for the "Elements-50-0-text"      # Title
    And I enter "Iterate All Non-Feature Coverages" for the "Elements-49-0-text"      # Subject
    And I enter "Charlottesville, VA" into "Elements-38-0-free"
    And I click "add_element_38"
    And I enter "UVa" into "Elements-38-1-free"
    And I click on "Add Item"
    And I click "Test Iterate All Non-Feature Coverages"
    When I click "View Public Page"
    Then I should see the following output in unordered list "#item-coverage":
      | false |
      | false |
